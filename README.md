## Description

As college students, finding the time and resources to cook nutritious, affordable meals can be challenging. Eating out frequently is expensive, and meal preparation can feel overwhelming, especially when trying to use available ingredients creatively. The hardest part is often figuring out what to make with what’s already in the kitchen.

To address this problem, I propose *ChefIT*—a full-stack web application that helps users discover quick, delicious, and authentic recipes based on the ingredients they already have. By simply inputting their groceries, raw materials, or leftovers, users can instantly receive a variety of recipe suggestions, minimizing food waste while maximizing convenience.

## Target Users

The primary users of ChefIT are individuals, particularly college students and working professionals, who struggle with meal inspiration and efficiency in cooking. Many students lack the time, experience, or creativity to experiment with new recipes, often resorting to repetitive meals or takeout. ChefIT empowers them to explore diverse meal options effortlessly, making cooking more accessible, enjoyable, and cost-effective.
